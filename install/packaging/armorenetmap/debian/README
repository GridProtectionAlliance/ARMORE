The ArmoreNetMap package originally comes from the NetMap Repository from Luigi: 
http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/

In our repository we are using the forked NetMap code from fichtner due to enabled forwarding code:
https://github.com/fichtner/netmap

Upon installing the ArmoreNetMap package the following directories are created by the Debian Control File:

1. /lib/modules/3.12.0-armore/kernel/net/armorenetmap
2. /usr/share/armorenetmap

The first directory is where the kernel modules live. 
The second is where the packet-generation tools are located.
This package requires the 3.12 Linux Kernel to work.
