.SH NAME
.B broctl
\- interactive shell for managing Bro installations
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B broctl
<command>

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B broctl
is an interactive interface for managing a Bro installation which allows
you to, e.g., start/stop the monitoring or update its configuration.

Before actually running
.B broctl
you first need to edit the
.B broctl.cfg
,
.B node.cfg
, and
.B networks.cfg
files. In the
.B broctl.cfg
file, you should review the
.B broctl
options and make sure the options are set correctly for your
environment. Next, edit the
.B node.cfg
file and specify the nodes that you will be running. Finally, edit the
.B networks.cfg
file and list each network (see the examples in the file for the format to
use) that is considered local to the monitored environment.
