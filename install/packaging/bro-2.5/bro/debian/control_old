Description: interactive shell for managing Bro installations
 Bro is primarily a security monitor that inspects all traffic on a
 link in depth for signs of suspicious activity. More generally,
 however, Bro supports a wide range of traffic analysis tasks even
 outside of the security domain, including performance measurements
 and helping with trouble-shooting.
 .
 This package contains broctl, an interactive shell for managing Bro
 installations.
