###Running DNP3 from Automatik
###
###


git clone --recursive https://github.com/automatak/dnp3.git

cmake ../dnp3
make -j
sudo make install 

Go to dnp3_master and dnp3_slave and do:
make


for dnp3_slave, the source files changed for database.h (prepended an I to the library)
You will have to do:
sudo ln -s IDatabase.h /usr/local/include/opendnp3/outstation/Database.h

The files are pretty much all based on the examples provided by automatik
