To get RRDtool working within ARMORE, you will first need to install the dependencies:

#apt-get install collectd
#apt-get install collectd-dev
#apt-get install rrdtool
#apt-get install python-rrdtool

The javascript library is from: https://github.com/manuelluis/jsrrdgraph
All the required scripts are located in the js folder

Collectd stores system stats over in /var/lib/collectd/rrd/<HOSTNAME> which can be plotted either
by the RRDtool, python-rrdtool, or the javascript library.

Example python and shell scripts are provided.

The test folder has the example javascript for the system load which can be dropped into a webserver.
To execute the library first put a symbolic link in the test folder to the rrd files
(i.e ln -s /var/lib/collectd/rrd/<HostName> rrd) 

Also make sure this is executing in a webserver (i.e. nginx/apache/etc) as file:\\\ extensions won't directly load from the js.
