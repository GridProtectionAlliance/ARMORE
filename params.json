{"name":"ARMORE","tagline":"Applied Resiliency for More Trustworthy Grid Operation","body":"### Welcome to ARMORE.\r\nApplied Resiliency for More Trustworthy Grid Operations (ARMORE) substation security appliance that is funded by the Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Electricity Cyber Security for Energy Delivery Systems,). The ARMORE project is a collaboration among industry and academia to create a solution that fills significant security gaps in a manner that is capable of being effectively implemented by utilities.  \r\nARMORE will be an open-source system that can perform inspection of network packets and alarm on communication that does not comply with the specified ARMORE policy. ARMORE will be able to be configured to take action to block network traffic based on deep inspection of common substation communications protocols, such as DNP3. After validation for compliance with policy, ARMORE will also encapsulate and encrypt legacy communications and resiliently transmit this information among ARMORE nodes (such as between the substation and the control center). Through this peer-based framework for secure information exchange, ARMORE will provide the functionality to push secure, fault-tolerant real-time communication capabilities deeper into critical utility networks.\r\nThe ARMORE application suite will include (1) the services that run on the Linux OS and is the software that is the core of the substation appliance, (2) a policy and configuration management graphical user interface, and (4) a configuration store to securely house configuration information for all nodes deployed within a utilityâ€™s infrastructure.\r\nThe engine within the ARMORE service that will inspect network traffic will be based on the existing well-vetted network analysis platform, Bro.  Bro is an open-source solution released under the permissive Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license that is specifically designed for semantic analysis of network traffic in process control and other networks that are purpose-built for high-performance using domain-specific protocols. With Bro integrated within it, ARMORE will provide the ability to collect statistics, inspect relevant traffic, and apply policies to that traffic to help secure critical infrastructure from attackers all while securely communicating both known and unknown protocols to their intended destination via a fault tolerant middleware.  \r\nA well-constructed strategy for utility acceptance and adoption is required to assure deployment of any new system or software application. The project team believes that the utilities adopting ARMORE must be provided strong evidence that ARMORE adds value while not degrading communications reliability or availability. Therefore, in this design document, use cases are presented that provide a recommended progression of promotion of ARMORE into full production use. This progression includes a mode of deployment called Detection & Alarming that allows utilities to transparently deploy ARMORE in a substation with little impact or risk to existing systems as ARMORE security policy is developed and tested.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nContributions come from many sources, and this effort is a joint partnership between Grid Protection Alliance (GPA) and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, lead by @timyardley.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWant more information?
